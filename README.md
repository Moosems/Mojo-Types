# Mojo-Types

This repo contains some useful types and functions to use in Mojo. To use a type/function, simply take the file from its folder and import it into your project. Documentation on each type can be found in the respective README of the folder.
<br>
Documentation should follow a style similar to that used in the official [Mojo Docs](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/).

## Contributing:

To add a type/function: put it in its own folder which has a main file (same name as the folder) and a README containing documentation and open a PR.
<br>
To update docs: open a PR with your fixes and they will be reviewed shortly thereafter.

## Here are the types/functions currently in the repo:
 - ### `Array` (type)
 - ### `input()` (function)
